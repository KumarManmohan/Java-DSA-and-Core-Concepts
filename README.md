## Core Concepts

A collection of introductory programs focusing on the fundamentals of the Java language.

*   **FunctionsPrintMyName.java**: Demonstrates basic function creation and usage with `String` arguments.
*   **FunctionsPrintTheSum.java**: A simple function to calculate and return the sum of two integers.
*   **averageof3.java**: Calculates the average of three numbers.
*   **Homework1Calc.java**: A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.
*   **UserinputCount.java**: A program that counts positive, negative, and zero inputs from a user in a loop.
*   **numComparison.java / GreaterOfTwo.java**: Examples of using conditional statements (`if-else`) to compare numbers.
*   **Infiniteloop.java**: An example of creating and controlling loops.

## Algorithms

Implementations of common and fundamental algorithms.

*   **FunctionsPrintTheFactorial.java**: A function to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.
*   **Exponential.java**: A custom function to calculate exponents without using `Math.pow()`.
*   **GCDCalculator.java**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers.

## How to Compile and Run

All programs in this repository can be compiled and run from the command line.

```bash
# Compile the Java file
javac YourFileName.java

# Run the compiled code
java YourFileName
```
